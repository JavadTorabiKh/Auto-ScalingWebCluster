## 🌟 Project Overview

This project provides a **fully automated solution** for managing web clusters on VMware ESXi with two core integrated capabilities:

1. **Intelligent Auto-Scaling** based on traffic and resource utilization
2. **Automated Backup System** with enterprise-grade encryption

> 💡 **Why This Project Stands Out**  
> The first open-source system that seamlessly combines cluster management and backup solutions for VMware using Ansible!
